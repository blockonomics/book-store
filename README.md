<summary>Setting up Environment Configurations</summary>

- Open the `.env` file and replace the dummy connection URL with the connection URL of your PostgreSQL database. Follow the steps in this [guide](https://www.prisma.io/dataguide/postgresql/setting-up-a-local-postgresql-database) to create a local PostgreSQL database.
For example, if your database is hosted on [Supabase](https://supabase.com/), the URL might look as follows:
  
```
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@db.ObubJTKrJYcPSkdsWqms.supabase.co:5432/postgres"
```

-  Make sure you have your Blockonomics API Key handy. To get one for free, [create your account](https://www.blockonomics.co/register#) and go to the `STORE` tab on [merchant page](https://www.blockonomics.co/merchants). Now place your api key to the `BLOCKONOMICS_API_KEY` variable in `.env` file.

```
  BLOCKONOMICS_API_KEY=[API_KEY]
```

 - Create your [Blockonomics payment button](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1sE2r5tDkNY). Get the button code and assign it to the `BLOCKONOMICS_PARENT_UID` variable in `.env` file as shown below.

```
  BLOCKONOMICS_PARENT_UID=[PARENT_UID]
```

- Remember to save the changes.

You should see the following output:

```
  Environment variables loaded from /Users/nikolasburk/Desktop/nextjs-guide/blogr-starter/.env 
Prisma schema loaded from prisma/schema.prisma

ðŸš€  Your database is now in sync with your schema. Done in 2.10s
```
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Start the server</summary>

  ```
    npm run dev
  ```
  
  This will start the application on your localhost.

  To test the code locally, follow instructions from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ydk32avIgo) video and make sure to place the `<domain>/api/confirmation` as your order hook url. Here `<domain>` is the domain you get from reverse proxy (Ngro  k/localtunnel).
